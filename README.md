###Execution
If you want to offer your pc as a resource to the network run:  
`python3 Server.py` and proceed with the instructions that are prompted. 
Else if you want to use the networks resources run:  
`python3 main.py` and proceed with the prompted instructions in the program.

### Disclaimer  
- Virtual Enironment dependencies are under requirements.txt .
- Need to have Python 3.7 to use the latest modules of asyncio and to run this project.
- Need to have a Linux environment for using the timeout command in Server.py 
- Good news for Windows users! It also works on Ubuntu Subsystem on Windows. :) 
- You can find an example script(example_script.py) for using distributed map reduce with its required syntax.
